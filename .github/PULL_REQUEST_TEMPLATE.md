#### TODO

If you can't meet the requirements of the checklist above, create a short to-do
list and add the relevant parts:

- [ ] Submit changes to the documentation
- [ ] Document the BC breaks

If the code is not finished yet because you don't have time to finish it or
because you want early feedback on your work, add an item to the to-do list:

- [ ] Finish the code
- [ ] Add tests as they have not been updated yet
- [ ] Gather feedback for my changes

As long as you have items in the to-do list, please prefix the pull request
title with `[WIP]`.
Remove the TODO section if your pull request is complete and has no tasks.

#### Description

Add as much details as possible about your changes (don't hesitate to give code
examples to illustrate your points). The pull request description helps the code
review and it serves as a reference when the code is merged.

#### Purpose

If your pull request is about adding a new feature or modifying an existing one,
explain the rationale for the changes. Why you added this feature, or why you
have done the changes in the way you did?
