This view is used in the form for pages, and allows to configure settings like in which navigation this page will be
shown, what the shadow resp. fallback locale is and shows more information about the page like the changed and created
date and the corresponding users.

This is an own view and not the more generic [`Form`](#form-1) view, because it has to dynamically show and hide certain
elements based on its values.
