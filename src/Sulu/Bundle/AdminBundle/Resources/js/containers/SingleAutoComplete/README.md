This component uses the [`SingleAutoComplete` component](#singleautocomplete) and attaches it to a `SingleSelectionStore`. 
This store will contain the currently selected values of the `SingleAutoComplete` container.
The `displayProperty` indicates which of the properties of the items in the `MultiSelectionStore` will be used to display the items.
To define which properties will be searched by the `MultiAutoComplete` the `searchProperties` prop can be used.
