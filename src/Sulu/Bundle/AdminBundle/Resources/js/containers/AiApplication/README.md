The `AiApplication` is an additional application container to hook into the Sulu application. It is used to render the
`Ai` component, which is a container to display the AI overlay (incl. `Translator` and `WritingAssistant`).

> **_NOTE:_** This container is experimental can be changed in the future and is not covered by our BC promise.
