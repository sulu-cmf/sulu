The `Application` is the main component, which renders the general layout of Sulu. Its most important job is to render
the right component based on the values in the [`Router`](#router) using the [`ViewRenderer`](#viewrenderer). Besides
that it also renders a [`Toolbar`](#toolbar) and a [`SplitView`](#splitview)  component, which complete the basic
layout.
