The `ResourceTabs` view shows all the children of its defined route as a [`Tab`](#tab), and uses their `tabTitle`
option as the title for the tab. This is enabled by the [`Router`](#router) with handling children and parent routes
and by the [`ViewRenderer`](#viewrenderer) with nesting these routes into different views.
