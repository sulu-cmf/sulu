This component is based on the [`MediaSelectionOverlay`](#mediaselectionoverlay) and allows to select multiple medias
from the `MediaCollection`(#mediacollection). It almost has the same props as the `MediaSelectionOverlay`, except for
the `ListStore` objects and the `CollectionStore`, for whose creation this component is responsible.
